6.1 Visual Design Philosophy
UNIQUE & MEMORABLE AESTHETIC:

- Modern, approachable design that reduces dental anxiety
- Warm, welcoming atmosphere balanced with professional credibility
- Personality-driven design that tells your clinic's unique story

COLOR PALETTE (Contemporary Approach):
Option 1 - Warm & Inviting:
  * Primary: Soft terracotta, warm sage green, or muted coral
  * Secondary: Cream, warm off-white, or soft beige
  * Accent: Gold, copper, or deep teal
  * Neutrals: Charcoal gray instead of pure black

Key Principles:
